## Purpose

This application is aimed at people wanting to search for their favorite bands to determine where and when they will be performing next. From the userâ€™s initial search, they can see the upcoming shows with details on city and venue, they have the ability to buy tickets directly from the search results, as well as view a map for directions to the event to give them the ability to find nearby hotels, bars, restaurants, etc.
The users can save their band searches as favorites for future visits to the site should they want to view the venues or buy tickets at a later time.
